        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science and computer engineering currently doing honours in computer science. During my degree, I have developed an excellent eye for detail, due to the high demands of assignments. As a result, I am also able to work under pressure. Through using my communication skills when working as a tutor, I have developed successful working relationships and therefore improving my productivity. I am open to a challenging environment that is exciting, innovative, and offers room for growth. I am interested in improving the lives of people using technology.</p>
        <p>I am an open-minded person and a self-starter who takes initiative with or without direction. I'm usually the one who takes an initiative in my group by arranging meetings and starting things right away! I like to challenge myself and I am constantly looking for new ways of improving my skills, the way I work, and respond. I seek feedback to help me improve and sometimes some self-introspection. I like to watch movies and series and listen to music. To clear my head I usually go for long walks.</p>
